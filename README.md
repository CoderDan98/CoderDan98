# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m [Your Name], a passionate developer from [Your Location].

## About Me

My journey into the world of coding started when I was 17, not entirely sure what I wanted to do with my life. Growing up as a gamer, I always had a keen interest in computers. Determined to find my place, I went around posting my CV through business letterboxes in search of a job.

I landed my first job at a recruitment agency, where I had the opportunity to work in various departments including marketing, finance, payroll, health & safety, resources, and operations. Eventually, I found myself on the hardware team within the IT department. It was there that I got my big break when a developer left, and I was given the chance to try out for the development team.

From the moment I wrote my first "Hello, World!" program using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I was hooked. This newfound passion led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, and Iâ€™ve been climbing the ranks ever since.

Now, with a strong foundation and diverse experience, Iâ€™m excited to continue growing, learning, and contributing to the tech community.
